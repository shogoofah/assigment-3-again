<p class="pa">
    Diana Joseph captures members of the Sikka Gang and confiscates a haul of cocaine worth 1,000 crores. An undercover officer Abbas Ali, known as Raunak, has joined Ashwathama alias Ashu, who is co-leader of the Sikka Gang. Raunak gives information about Ashu to Diana, while Ashu seeks help from corrupt NCB officer Devraj Subramaniam, who instructs another officer Deep Singh to add rohypnol to drinks made for police officers at the farewell party of IG Jayant Malik. Diana does not partake due to medication, but everyone else falls unconscious.

    A prisoner named Bholaa has been released from prison and Joseph tries to convince him to drive a truck taking the sedated officers to the hospital then on to Laalganj police station. Although reluctant at first, Bholaa agrees. Meanwhile, Ashu hires a bounty on Joseph and the rest of her police force. As Joseph, Bholaa and sidekick Kadchi drive they are attacked by various gangs. Deep Singh, who has hidden with the sedated officers, provides them with the location updates. A cat-and-mouse game ensues in which Bholaa kills all the goons. Ashu also sends his gang to attack the police station and to free his brother Nithari, who was caught with the cocaine.
    
    Inspector Angad Yadav, who was recently transferred to Laalganj,
    
    gets assigned by Joseph to defend the police station. When Ashu arrives with his gang, they try to breach the police station which is barricaded by Yadav and some students. Joseph is nearly tricked into ordering the release of the prisoners, but she realizes that it was a trap set by Nithari. Ashu manages to get inside the police station, but Yadav and the students manage to arrest him. One of the student Chetan gets strangled to death by Ashu's gang and Yadav, fuming with rage, kills Ashu. Joseph contacts medics to provide an emergency ambulance at a temple of Lord Shiva.
    
    As they wait, Bholaa narrates his past in which he was a notorious gangster in Uttar Pradesh and fell in love with a doctor Swara, who reciprocated his love after he saved her from being assaulted. Before their marriage, Bholaa gave up his gangster life, but Swara was killed by a ruthless gang leader known as Chomu Singh. Before dying, Swara gave birth to their daughter Jyoti, but Bholaa got separated from her after receiving a long-term prison sentence. Joseph shares her story about how she lost her unborn child when she was pregnant.
    
    An ambulance finally arrives and takes the sedated officers to hospital. After this, Ashu's henchman Bhoora also arrives. Before Bholaa is able to fight, Deep Singh stabs him and Bholaa is brutally injured.
